## Project Overview
Welcome to the SmartClass A.I.ssistant project. This project aims to develop a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to analyze images of students in a classroom or online meeting setting and categorize them into distinct states or activities.

## Project Parts
The project is divided into three parts:
1. **Data Collection, Cleaning, Labeling & Preliminary Analysis**
2. **CNN Model Development and Basic Evaluation**
3. **Bias Analysis, Model Refinement & Deep Evaluation**
